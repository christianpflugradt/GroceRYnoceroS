# GroceRYnoceroS

GrocerRynoceroS is a command line based tool to create grocery lists.

A grocery list consists of groceries which belong to categories such as dairy goods, vegetables and so on.
Grocery lists are created for a grocery store with a defined order of categories
optimized to make the shopping experience as efficient as possible.

    GrocerRYnoceroS is still work in progress.
    This readme will be updated once the tool is considered production ready.
